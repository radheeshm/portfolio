    <section id="projects">
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Managed and executed projects that improved operational efficiency, automated workflows, and enhanced business intelligence strategies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Photoshop JavaScript (JSX)</strong> - I developed various multimedia scripts, including automation scripts for repetitive tasks, batch scripts for bulk operations, and interactive scripts for user engagement. I also created animation and video processing scripts for motion graphics and editing, audio scripts for sound manipulation, and image scripts for filtering and enhancement. Additionally, I worked on web multimedia scripts for website integration and gaming scripts for interactive experiences.</li>
            <li><strong>Excel VBA Macros</strong> - These scripts automate tasks like formatting reports (Edmunds Report), managing colors (Create Color Log, Color Swatches), processing data (Pivot Table, Formula to Values, Arval Merger), converting files (Save as PDF), cleaning text (Replace Special Character), and ensuring data quality (QA Check).</li>
            <li><strong>Python Scripts</strong> - These scripts handle image resizing, format conversion, file management, and data processing. They assist with Excel merging, searching time sheets, and automating tasks like converting Python scripts to executables. Other tools help with copyright submissions, exporting Blender scene data, and downloading files from the web.</li>
            <li><strong>SLA Performance Report</strong> - Analyze the Edmunds SLA report and calculate the percentage of successful deliveries. To address this requirement, we utilized Python programming to develop a solution that automates the analysis of the SLA report provided by the Edmunds team. The code processes the report and generates Excel tables that facilitate the automatic calculation of success percentages. </li>
            <li><strong>Web Scraping</strong> - Gathering data on the number of brands and models for each brand in the US and FR Emporio regions is a labor-intensive task. The process involves collecting detailed information from multiple live URLs associated with Emporio, which can be quite time-consuming.  To address this challenge, we developed a Python program designed to automate the data collection process. The program efficiently retrieves comprehensive information from over 30 live Emporio URLs. Specifically, it gathers data on Year, Make, Model, Alias, Trims, Colors, and available Products. </li>
            <li><strong>Model Tracking System</strong> - The Model Tracking System is designed to manage multimedia domain tasks by tracking model flow between the teams, monitoring which teams and individuals are working on each model.</li>
